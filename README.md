  # Bookify - Streamlit Version 

  Note: Please ensure you have installed Streamlit (pip install streamlit). Some users have reported issues when running outside of a virtual environment. I'm running it in a conda virtual 
        environment to be safe.  

  Additional Dependencies: openai library (& associated API key).
